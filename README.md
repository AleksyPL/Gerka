My own RPG game.

The game was made for code practicing. This project contains some solutions, that I am not proud of. At some point, this project has become my bachelor thesis. Check the documentation about the game in the WMP-99005-LIC.pdf file. Documentation is only available in Polish, sorry :) I am not going to add more content for that version of the game. My next milestone will be a remake of this game on the Unity engine. Keep fingers crossed.
